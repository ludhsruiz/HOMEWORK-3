## · How the CRM works

Our lovely <b>CRM</b> is a very intuitive application, however, if you are using it for the first time, you might face
doubts about what the commands are. If so, please type "HELP" for further information.
We recommend a "POPULATE" command to fill the database with some data 

Just like the beatles "Help! I need somebody! Help!"
